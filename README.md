# fractals

I've recently been reading (The Misbehaviour of Markets by Benoit Mandelbrot)[https://dichgiacamchi.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/the_misbehavior_of_markets_-_benoit_mandelbrot.pdf]

There are some really cool graphics from computer simulations that I'd love to make to get a better idea of how things work. 

Here are a few: 
- Create a basic fractal 
- Make a random fractal creating a 'coastline' 
- Play around with fractal Brownian motion by creating fake market data

Hopefully I will put some animations here as and when I make them
